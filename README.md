# HR Employee Attrition Prediction — Machine Learning Classification Project
This project focuses on predicting whether an employee is likely to leave an organization using machine learning classification techniques. By analyzing HR data—including demographics, job roles, performance metrics, satisfaction levels, and work environment factors—the model provides insights that support workforce planning and retention strategies.

📘 Project Overview

The notebook walks through all major stages of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline:

🔍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding dataset structure and summary statistics

Visualizing turnover patterns across age groups, job roles, salary levels, and departments

Identifying correlations and key behavioral trends

Detecting missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies

⚙️ 2. Data Preprocessing

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling numerical features

Handling imbalanced classes

Cleaning noisy fields

Splitting the data into training/testing sets

🧩 3. Feature Engineering

Creating and refining features to improve predictive performance, such as:

Job satisfaction levels

Overtime indicators

Years at company / years since last promotion

Work-life balance scores

Monthly income and compensation structure

🤖 4. Model Development & Evaluation

The project implements and compares multiple machine learning classifiers:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Models

Models are evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision & Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

The best-performing model is selected based on balanced accuracy and generalization.

📊 5. Key Insights

The analysis reveals factors with the strongest impact on attrition, including:

Overtime workload

Low job satisfaction

Salary frustration

Lack of career advancement

Long tenure without promotion
These insights can help HR teams design targeted retention strategies.
